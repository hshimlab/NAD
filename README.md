# NAD
Long-read sequencing offers direct sequencing benefits but is constrained by limited sample amounts. We propose Noise-Augmented Direct (NAD) sequencing, a method mitigating this constraint by integrating noise DNA and adaptive sampling. Leveraging adaptive sampling from emerging nanopore sequencing technology, NAD sequencing selectively depletes noise DNA, enhancing the sequencing of target DNA. In this study, Lambda phage genome DNA serves as noise DNA to augment samples with low bacterial genome amounts (1 ng to 300 ng). 

  - Cost-effective flow cells demonstrate NAD sequencing effectively detects target DNA with input quantities as low as 1 ng. Salmonella enterica genome assembly at 30% completion and 98% accuracy is achieved with 3 ng input. 
  - High-throughput flow cells yield near-complete (99.9%) assembly of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa genome with 99.97% accuracy at 300 ng input.

This proof-of-concept study underscores NAD sequencing's potential in fortifying long-read sequencing robustness for small DNA/RNA samples through noise augmentation and adaptive sampling.
